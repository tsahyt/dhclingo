	abstract = {The {CDCL} algorithm is the leading solution adopted by state-of-the-art solvers for {SAT}, {SMT}, {ASP}, and others. Experiments show that the performance of {CDCL} solvers can be significantly boosted by embedding domain-specific heuristics, especially on large real-world problems. However, a proper integration of such criteria in off-the-shelf {CDCL} implementations is not obvious. In this paper, we distill the key ingredients that drive the search of {CDCL} solvers, and propose a general framework for designing and implementing new heuristics. We implemented our strategy in an {ASP} solver, and we experimented on two industrial domains. On hard problem instances, state-of-the-art implementations fail to find any solution in acceptable time, whereas our implementation is very successful and finds all solutions.},
