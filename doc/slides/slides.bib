	abstract = {Abstract
Answer Set Programming ({ASP}) is a popular logic programming paradigm that has been applied for solving a variety of complex problems. Among the most challenging real-world applications of {ASP} are two industrial problems defined by Siemens: the Partner Units Problem ({PUP}) and the Combined Configuration Problem ({CCP}). The hardest instances of {PUP} and {CCP} are out of reach for state-of-the-art {ASP} solvers. Experiments show that the performance of {ASP} solvers could be significantly improved by embedding domain-specific heuristics, but a proper effective integration of such criteria in off-the-shelf {ASP} implementations is not obvious. In this paper the combination of {ASP} and domain-specific heuristics is studied with the goal of effectively solving real-world problem instances of {PUP} and {CCP}. As a byproduct of this activity, the {ASP} solver wasp was extended with an interface that eases embedding new external heuristics in the solver. The evaluation shows that our domain-heuristic-driven {ASP} solver finds solutions for all the real-world instances of {PUP} and {CCP} ever provided by Siemens.},

	abstract = {The {CDCL} algorithm is the leading solution adopted by state-of-the-art solvers for {SAT}, {SMT}, {ASP}, and others. Experiments show that the performance of {CDCL} solvers can be significantly boosted by embedding domain-specific heuristics, especially on large real-world problems. However, a proper integration of such criteria in off-the-shelf {CDCL} implementations is not obvious. In this paper, we distill the key ingredients that drive the search of {CDCL} solvers, and propose a general framework for designing and implementing new heuristics. We implemented our strategy in an {ASP} solver, and we experimented on two industrial domains. On hard problem instances, state-of-the-art implementations fail to find any solution in acceptable time, whereas our implementation is very successful and finds all solutions.},

	abstract = {{AbstractMusic} composition used to be a pen and paper activity. These days music is often composed with the aid of computer software, even to the point where the computer composes parts of the score autonomously. The composition of most styles of music is governed by rules. We show that by approaching the automation, analysis and verification of composition as a knowledge representation task and formalising these rules in a suitable logical language, powerful and expressive intelligent composition tools can be easily built. This application paper describes the use of answer set programming to construct an automated system, named Anton, that can compose melodic, harmonic and rhythmic music, diagnose errors in human compositions and serve as a computer-aided composition tool. The combination of harmonic, rhythmic and melodic composition in a single framework makes Anton unique in the growing area of algorithmic composition. With near real-time composition, Anton reaches the point where it can not only be used as a component in an interactive composition tool but also has the potential for live performances and concerts or automatically generated background music in a variety of applications. With the use of a fully declarative language and an “off-the-shelf” reasoning engine, Anton provides the human composer a tool which is significantly simpler, more compact and more versatile than other existing systems.},

Often isolated parts of conﬁguration problems can be solved by mapping them to wellstudied problems for which efﬁcient heuristics exist (graph coloring, bin-packing, etc.). Unfortunately, these heuristics may fail to work when applied to a problem that combines two or more subproblems. In the paper we show how to formulate a combined conﬁguration problem in Answer Set Programming ({ASP}) and to solve it using heuristics a` la hclasp. In addition, we present a novel method for heuristic generation based on a combination of greedy search with {ASP} that allows to improve the performance of an {ASP} solver.},

The knowledge representation and reasoning ({KRR}) framework of answer set programming ({ASP}) offers a rich representation language and high performance solvers. Therefore, {ASP} has become very attractive for the representation and solving of search-problems both for academia and industry. This article focuses on the latest industrial applications of {ASP}. We do not only present successful applications of {ASP} but also describe the development process and the design of {ASP} programs in an industrial context. Finally, we discuss current approaches to tackle the most significant application challenges such as grounding and runtime improvements by heuristics.},
