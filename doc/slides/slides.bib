	abstract = {The {CDCL} algorithm is the leading solution adopted by state-of-the-art solvers for {SAT}, {SMT}, {ASP}, and others. Experiments show that the performance of {CDCL} solvers can be significantly boosted by embedding domain-specific heuristics, especially on large real-world problems. However, a proper integration of such criteria in off-the-shelf {CDCL} implementations is not obvious. In this paper, we distill the key ingredients that drive the search of {CDCL} solvers, and propose a general framework for designing and implementing new heuristics. We implemented our strategy in an {ASP} solver, and we experimented on two industrial domains. On hard problem instances, state-of-the-art implementations fail to find any solution in acceptable time, whereas our implementation is very successful and finds all solutions.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an abstract problem derived from a combination of Siemens product conﬁguration problems encountered in practice. Often isolated parts of conﬁguration problems can be solved by mapping them to wellstudied problems for which efﬁcient heuristics exist (graph coloring, bin-packing, etc.). Unfortunately, these heuristics may fail to work when applied to a problem that combines two or more subproblems. In the paper we show how to formulate a combined conﬁguration problem in Answer Set Programming ({ASP}) and to solve it using heuristics a` la hclasp. In addition, we present a novel method for heuristic generation based on a combination of greedy search with {ASP} that allows to improve the performance of an {ASP} solver.},
